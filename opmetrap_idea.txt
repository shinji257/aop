[5:11:23 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): btw new code. :P working on the opme trap at the moment.
if ( plugin.getConfig().getBoolean("opmetrap",false)) {
    player.kickPlayer("You are not entitled to op status.");
    Bukkit.broadcastMessage(player.getDisplayName() + ChatColor.RESET + " has been kicked: You are not entitled to op status.");
    aOP.log.info("[" + plugin.getDescription().getName() + "] " + player.getName() + " has been kicked for trying to use /opme");
}
[5:12:12 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): ideas on how to make the trap entertaining to others on the server?
[5:12:40 AM] Rockes: Use some code from NoClip plugins & make enable a 'God Mode' so they continue to fall forever :P
[5:12:48 AM | Edited 5:12:52 AM] Rockes: then onLogin it resets xD
[5:13:14 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): lol...
[5:13:22 AM] Rockes: :3
[5:13:42 AM | Edited 5:13:47 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): i'd prob have to actually track who is like that to reset them onLogin
[5:13:59 AM] Rockes: Why not just reset all?
[5:15:13 AM | Edited 5:15:18 AM] Rockes: =D

"Heads-up...we're extending Double XP through Tuesday morning at 10am/PST. You're welcome. "
[5:15:23 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): i don't think there is a "noclip" marker for me to check and just shutting off god mode on everyone may not be as easy as it seems since that is an essentials function although for the moment i could just to a console dispatcher call to run /god on the player.
[5:16:14 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): I'm trying to do stuff that will be rather universal.  Remember this stuff will make it into the release code posted on bukkitdev too.  I don't want any dependencies on outside code or reliances on commands the admin might not have.
[5:16:31 AM] Rockes: Ok
[5:17:04 AM | Edited 5:17:06 AM] Rockes: Soft Depend on in it?
[5:17:22 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Well ya... ofc
[5:17:51 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): I mean I like the idea but how do you check and reset when they join back?
[5:18:14 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): I guess I could look at the y value and if it is insanely low then that would be an indicator
[5:18:22 AM | Edited 5:18:23 AM] Rockes: Add a node to player on Op & if player has permission
[5:18:25 AM] Rockes: Remove onlOgin
[5:18:28 AM] Rockes: ?
[5:18:43 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Well I could use vault for that.
[5:18:54 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): node like aop.opfail ?
[5:19:19 AM] Rockes: No like ex player executes /op (or wtvr) & if they don't have perms it adds a noe to them
[5:19:27 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Right I know
[5:19:36 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): That's why I said I could use vault for that.  Permissions integration
[5:19:48 AM] Rockes: ahhh
[5:19:50 AM] Rockes: kk
[5:19:53 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Although I'll check to see if it is possible to add that with just bukkit stuff
[5:21:03 AM] Rockes: k
[5:21:09 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): So...
addPermission("aop.opfail")
teleport(0,-5,0)
isGod(true)
broadcast(player.getDisplayName + " has tried to use /opme and has been sent to the void")
[5:21:56 AM] Rockes: Broadcast to players with node aop.getbroadcast ?
[5:22:26 AM | Edited 5:22:28 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): onLogin...
hasPermission("aop.opfail") {
removePermission("aop.opfail")
teleport(getWorld().getSpawn())
isGod(false)
}
[5:22:43 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): actually the broadcast I was thinking would be a full broadcast to the server
[5:22:53 AM | Edited 5:22:59 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Just sort of that humiliation factor there for trying
[5:23:25 AM] Rockes: Yes but what if servers don't want it to announce? :P
[5:23:32 AM] Rockes: Config option to stop it?
[5:23:39 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): I'll add a silence option for it.
[5:24:05 AM] Rockes: [5:22 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): 

<<< getWorld().getSpawn())
[5:24:06 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): the standard notify message would happen as well just like normal.  console logging will add an additional message to indicate a player was sent to the void.
[5:24:08 AM] Rockes: Sends to spawn yes?
[5:24:14 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Yea that's the idea.
[5:24:19 AM] Robert Pendell (shinji257): Not sure of the exact string to use.
[5:24:32 AM] Rockes: Maybe just send them back where they came from?
[5:24:54 AM | Edited 5:24:58 AM] Rockes: Code from Herobrine-API might work as it sends you to 'Herobrines Graveyard' (a world)
